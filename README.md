# Project-NYC-Green-Taxi-

### The project involves the following key steps:
**Data Collection: NYC link:** https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

### Competition Description:
Ask aIf "Total_amount" is the predicted variable, you can use the other variables in the dataset to make predictions about the total amount charged to passengers for each trip. The specific objectives you can pursue using "Total_amount" as the target variable .<br>

With 17 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.<br>

### Comprehensive Data Exploration with Python.
- Understand how variables are distributed and how they interact
- Apply different transformations before training machine learning models

### Fare Taxi EDA
- Learn to use visualization techniques to study missing data and distributions
- Includes correlation heatmaps, p, and t-SNE to help inform appropriate inputs to a linear model

### A Study on Regression Applied to the Dataset
- Demonstrate effective tactics for feature engineering
- Explore linear regression with different regularization methods including ridge, LASSO, and ElasticNet using scikit-learn

### Regularized Linear Models
- Build a basic linear model

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step also involves transforming categorical variables into numerical representations, normalizing numeric features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.

**Model Training:** Implementing linear regression using appropriate libraries or frameworks. The training process involves fitting the model to the training data, estimating the coefficients (slope and intercept), and optimizing the model's performance by minimizing the residual errors between the predicted and actual values.

**Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained linear regression model using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts the values and indicate its overall accuracy.

### Goal
If "Total_amount" is the predicted variable, you can use the other variables in the dataset to make predictions about the total amount charged to passengers for each trip. The specific objectives you can pursue using "Total_amount" as the target variable may include.
